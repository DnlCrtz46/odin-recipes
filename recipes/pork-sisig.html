    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pork sisig is a delectable Filipino dish renowned for its bold and savory flavors. It features 
        finely chopped pork, often including pig's face and ears, marinated and then pan-fried until 
        crispy. The dish is then mixed with aromatic ingredients like onions, garlic, and chili peppers, 
        creating a harmonious blend of textures and tastes. Served on a sizzling hotplate, pork sisig 
        is often topped with a raw egg that cooks upon contact, adding a luscious richness to the dish. 
        With its satisfying crunch and enticing combination of flavors, pork sisig is a beloved 
        culinary delight that captures the essence of Filipino cuisine.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound pork (pig's face, ears, belly, or a combination), boiled and grilled, then finely 
            chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 to 3 pieces red or green chili peppers (siling labuyo), minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon calamansi or lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 raw egg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional garnishes: chopped green onions, chopped fresh cilantro, crispy pork skin 
            (chicharrón), chopped red onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the pork until tender. Once cooked, grill or broil it to achieve a crispy texture. 
            Finely chop the grilled pork into small pieces.</li>
        <li>In a pan, heat the cooking oil over medium heat. Sauté the minced garlic until fragrant and 
            slightly golden. Add the chopped onions and cook until they become translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the finely chopped grilled pork to the pan. Allow it to cook and get slightly crispy.</li>
        <li>Mix in the minced chili peppers. Adjust the quantity according to your desired level of 
            spiciness.</li>
        <li>Pour in the soy sauce and stir to evenly distribute the flavors.</li>
        <li>Add the mayonnaise and calamansi or lemon juice to the pan. Mix well to coat the pork and 
            create a creamy texture.</li>
        <li>Taste the mixture and season with salt and pepper as needed. The soy sauce and mayonnaise 
            contribute to the overall seasoning.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pork sisig mixture to a sizzling hotplate. You can also use a regular serving 
            dish if a hotplate is not available.</li>
        <li>Crack a raw egg on top of the hot sizzling sisig. The heat of the hotplate will cook the 
            egg as it sizzles.</li>
        <li>Garnish the pork sisig with chopped green onions, fresh cilantro, crispy pork skin 
            (chicharrón), or chopped red onions for added flavor and texture.</li>
    </ol>
