    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pork adobo is a beloved Filipino dish renowned for its exquisite blend of flavors. Succulent 
        pieces of pork are marinated and then simmered in a fragrant mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, 
        garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns. This slow-cooking process allows the meat to absorb the 
        rich marinade, resulting in a tender and savory stew. The dish strikes a harmonious balance 
        between the saltiness of the soy sauce, the tanginess of the vinegar, and the earthiness of 
        the spices. Pork adobo is often served atop a bed of steamed rice, offering a delightful and 
        comforting culinary experience that captures the essence of Filipino cuisine.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 to 1.5 pounds pork (pork belly, pork shoulder, or pork ribs), cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vinegar (white vinegar or cane vinegar)</li>
        <li>1 head of garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water or chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional, for a touch of sweetness)</li>
        <li>1 onion, sliced (optional, for added flavor)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste (if needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the pork chunks, soy sauce, minced garlic, bay leaves, and black 
            peppercorns. Mix well to ensure the pork is coated with the marinade. Let the pork marinate 
            for at least 30 minutes, but for best results, marinate for a few hours or overnight in the 
            refrigerator.</li>
        <li>In a pot or a deep skillet, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat. Add the marinated 
            pork (reserving the marinade) and cook until the pork is lightly browned on all sides. This 
            adds depth of flavor to the dish.</li>
        <li>Pour in the reserved marinade and add the vinegar. Allow it to simmer for a couple of 
            minutes to reduce the vinegar's sharpness.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water or chicken broth to the pot. If using sugar, add it now for a touch of 
            sweetness that balances the flavors. Add the sliced onion if desired, as it can enhance 
            the taste.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the pork 
            simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the pork is tender and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning by adding more soy sauce, vinegar, or salt as 
            needed to achieve the desired balance of flavors.</li>
        <li>Serve the pork adobo over steamed rice. You can spoon some of the flavorful sauce over the 
            rice.</li>
    </ol>
