    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pork sinigang is a popular Filipino sour soup known for its tangy and savory flavors. This 
        comforting dish features tender pork chunks simmered with an assortment of vegetables, such as 
        kangkong (water spinach), radish, eggplant, and string beans, in a sour broth made from 
        tamarind or other souring agents. The combination of sourness from the broth and the richness 
        of the pork creates a harmonious balance that's both refreshing and hearty. Often served over 
        steamed rice, pork sinigang showcases the vibrant and diverse flavors that define Filipino 
        cuisine.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound pork (pork ribs, pork belly, or pork shoulder), cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium radish, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>1 eggplant, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup string beans (green beans), cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 bunch kangkong (water spinach), leaves and tender stems</li>
        <li>2 to 3 pieces green chili peppers (siling pansigang), optional</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons fish sauce (patis)</li>
        <li>Tamarind or tamarind mix (sinigang mix) for the sour flavor</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat a bit of cooking oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté 
            until they become translucent. Add the sliced tomatoes and cook until they start to soften 
            and release their juices.</li>
        <li>Add the pork chunks to the pot and sauté for a few minutes until they are lightly browned.
            Pour enough water into the pot to cover the pork. Bring it to a boil and then let it simmer 
            until the pork starts to become tender. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced radish to the pot and continue simmering until the radish is slightly 
            softened. Add the sliced eggplant and string beans, and let them cook until all the 
            vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Add fish sauce (patis) to the pot for a savory flavor. Adjust the amount according to your 
            taste preference. Add tamarind or sinigang mix to achieve the desired sourness. Start with 
            a small amount and gradually add more until you reach your preferred level of sourness.</li>
        <li>Add the kangkong (water spinach) leaves and tender stems to the pot. Stir and let them 
            wilt in the broth.</li>
        <li>Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning by adding salt, pepper, or more fish sauce if 
            needed. If desired, add the green chili peppers for a bit of heat.</li>
        <li>Serve the pork sinigang hot over steamed rice. The flavorful and tangy broth complements 
            the tender pork and variety of vegetables.</li>
    </ol>
